These scripts are the suggested solutions for the problem tasks. 
As mentioned and emphasized, there is no "one way" to do things when it comes to programming and coding.
What matters is the computational thinking and logic we apply to create our source code such that it is:
* Clean
* Easy to maintain
* Error free
* Reusable

In other words, focus more on the good practices of programming, and use these scripts as guidelines or models to try to emulate.
You may end up with a different code and even better code, so feel free and dare to try out your own code and create your own features.
There is also a vast community out there who would be willing and happy to help if you come into an obstacle or if you do not know how to solve a certain difficult question.
At the same time, always remember to Google and try to figure out on your own before asking another person!

Have fun programming and godspeed!
